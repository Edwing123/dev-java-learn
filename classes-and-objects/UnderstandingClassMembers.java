 * Understanding Class Members
 *
 * In Java, by default member declarations, specially fields,
 * belog to the instance built based off the class. This means
 * that even though two instances of the same class have
 * the same field, each field storage location is different(!).
 *
 * See how it is "storage location", not "value". This means that
 * if you change the value of a field in one instance, the
 * value of the same field in another instance will not change.
 *
 * Of course, there can be a case where a field of two instances
 * could be pointing to the same object.
 *
 * So, what about if instead we want the class itself to hold its
 * own kind of state?
 *
 * We can do this by using the static keyword. This keyword
 * makes the field belong to the class itself, not to the instances.
 *
 * members with the static modifier are called class members o static members.
