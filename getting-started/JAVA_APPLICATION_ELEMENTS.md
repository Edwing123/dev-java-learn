# Elements of a Java application

## Compiling and executing Java code

The first thing we need to do is to write some Java using a code editor of your preference. Then this code needs to get transformed into another format that your computer will execute. This transformation is performed by a special piece of software called a _compiler_.

The output generated by a compiler is meant to be read by a computers, not humans. Such file is often called an _executable_ or _binary file_.

In Java land, these two proceses of "compile" and "execute" are carried by two pieces of software provided by the Java Development Kit. However, from Java 11, these two steps can be combined into one: you can execute a single `.java` source file directly.
